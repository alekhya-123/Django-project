I have worked on building a college ERP system where a user i.e., a student or teacher can be created and stored in database by admin. The student can login into their portal and check the attendance and mark details. The teacher can login and update the schedule and mark details. The user creation and deletion can only be done by the admin and the teacher position can be applied by any and accepted by only admin. This project is done in Django using python where I have used URL mapping for connecting the admin, student login pages and also for getting into portal. We have also created different user interfaces for admin , student and teacher.
